# Terminal-Style Portfolio

A minimalist, terminal-themed personal portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is inspired by the portfolio at [https://github.com/theSa1/sa1-portfolio-tui](https://github.com/theSa1/sa1-portfolio-tui).

## Features

* **Interactive Terminal:** The homepage features a functional terminal with commands like `help`, `about`, `projects`, and `contact`.
* **SPA-like Navigation:** Smooth transitions between sections without page reloads.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Navigate using arrow keys and press 'q' to quit.
* **Typewriter Effect:** A dynamic splash screen introduces the site.
* **Contact Form:** Includes a working contact form that submits to Formspree.
